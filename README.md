This script is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in the bash shell. The player must enter letters to guess the hidden word before the allowed attempts are used up.

Game instructions
The game selects a random word from a word list.
The player has 10 attempts to guess the word by entering letters.
Letters that have already been guessed are displayed to avoid duplicates.
If the player guesses the word, they win the game. Otherwise he loses.
